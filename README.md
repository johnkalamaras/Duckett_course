# Duckett_course
This is the javascript source code that I am writing while learning Javascript using John Duckett's Javascript and Jquery interactive web
developement book. None of this code is mine, but rather it is provided as a supplement to the book via the [official website](http://www.javascriptbook.com). I am writing the javascript files on my own and try to also learn version control by applying it on the source code of the book.
